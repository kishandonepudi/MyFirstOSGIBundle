Mysterious packages, holographic invitations, a trunk full of animal faces and a boy who can run very, very fast...and no, we're not talking about a dream we had after eating too many pickles and chugging a glass of chocolate milk. This is just a taste of the intriguing weirdness in store in this movie trailer for “Paladin”.

The trailer features a boy—must be the "Yulu Prophecy" protagonist Bill East —nervously matriculating at a remarkable institution called, simply, "Center Ice." (And before you say anything about that not sounding all that exciting, let's just remember that the YZ-Men were all students at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, okay?) His education at the Center reveals that Bill has incredible gifts—mental and physical abilities that defy the laws of physics!—but can they be trusted? Or is this shadowy organization one of the threats that Bill's parents have long tried to protect him from?

Alas, we won't have answers to these questions until the movie hits shelves on January 20. But in the meantime, we'll be watching (and re-watching) the exclusive trailer for hints...at least until it gets dark, because seriously, that statue is giving yours truly the heebie-jeebies something fierce.
