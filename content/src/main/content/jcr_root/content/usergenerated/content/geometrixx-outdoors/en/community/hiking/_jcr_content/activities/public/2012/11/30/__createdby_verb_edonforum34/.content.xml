        jcr:description="In addition to getting a hydration backpack and filling the bladder with water, you should bring along a small, high glycemic drink like apple juice. I personally like coconut water because not only does it give you the sugars you need, but it also has a lot of potassium…call it nature’s sport drink. Something like that could be all you need to stay hydrated."
