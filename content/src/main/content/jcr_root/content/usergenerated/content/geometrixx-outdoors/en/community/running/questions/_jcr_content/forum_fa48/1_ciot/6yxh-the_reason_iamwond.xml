    jcr:description="The reason I am wondering this is because lately I have been having issues with my knee after I hit about the two-mile mark on my regular run. A friend told me that I should get shoes that are designed specifically for my pronation, but I’m in the dark about what exactly this means."

            jcr:description="I was told that I over pronate, and was recommended that I get a specific type of running shoe. I am currently running with the Mombassa Runners, and they are amazing. Jason, I know that doesn’t help you much unless you want to wear women’s shoes, but I hope you find what you’re looking for  Maybe take a look at the Nairobi Runners."

            jcr:description="Jason, I have become a bit of an expert on this topic because of my own knee problems. If you over pronate, then you excessively rotate your foot inward. This can cause all sorts of problems from the arch of your foot to your knee. If you under pronate, you don’t roll your foot enough, which can cause problems as well. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Honestly, your best option is to go to a doctor, physical therapist, or professional running coach and have your gait analyzed. They will tell you exactly what you are dealing with and what you can do to fix it."
