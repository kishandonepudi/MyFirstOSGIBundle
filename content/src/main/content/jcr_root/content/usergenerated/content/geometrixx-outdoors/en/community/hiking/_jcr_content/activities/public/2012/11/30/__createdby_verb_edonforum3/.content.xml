        jcr:description="Just had one of the scariest experiences of my life. I rounded a corner on the trail at about 9:30am when there were very few hikers around, and came within 10 feet of a moose that wasnâ€™t too happy to see me and started in my direction. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Remembering a ridiculously illustrated, yet informative sign post I read years ago, I ran uphill as fast as I could and got behind the first big tree I could find. I turned around to see the moose charging up the small hill right in my direction. I waved my hands from behind the tree until I heard a hard thud. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Looking around the side of the tree, I saw a dejected looking moose walking slowly back down to the trail. After twenty minutes of standing frozen, I decided to call it a day."
