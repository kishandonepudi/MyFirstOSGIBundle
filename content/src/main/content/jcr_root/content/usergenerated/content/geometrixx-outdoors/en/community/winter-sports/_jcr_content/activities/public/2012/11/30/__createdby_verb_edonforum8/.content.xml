        jcr:description="I know this may sound a bit cheesy and maybe I’m still just a kid at heart, but I love sledding! There is finally enough snow in a bowl up the canyon close to where I live that it’s worth it to make the trip.&#xd;&#xa;  &#xd;&#xa;Anyway, Josh, think I have found the perfect use for snowshoes. Back behind this bowl there are a bunch of snowshoe trails, and some of them get pretty steep. The great thing about the trails, though, is that they are giant one-way loops so you never face oncoming people. One of the trails gets really steep going downhill toward the end. I just got a little rocket sled that I can strap to my backpack so I can snowshoe to the top of this hill, take off my snowshoes and strap them on my backpack, and then sled down. I know. It’s pretty much the greatest thing you’ve ever heard."
