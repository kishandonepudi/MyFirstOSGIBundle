        jcr:description="My family and I are vacationing up in Yellowstone next month, and I am looking for some really good hikes to take them on. We are a small group of five. Our three kids are all grown and in college, and they love a challenge. My husband and I are experienced hikers, so something a little more challenging would be great. Thanks!"
