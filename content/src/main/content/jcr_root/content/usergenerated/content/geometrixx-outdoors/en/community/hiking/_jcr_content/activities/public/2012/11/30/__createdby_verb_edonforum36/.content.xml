        jcr:description="Congrats Emily! To be honest, you’re not going to find a black/white answer. Trust me I already looked. I took my son with me in a sling when he was two months old, and we didn’t have any issues at all. Just remember to bring all your essentials, including sunscreen, and also plan to take a lot longer than you normally would. Have fun! "
