        jcr:description="Donna, I have had to make this exact same decision. The answer depends on what you’re looking for. Do you want to spend a little extra or are you looking to do this on a budget (if you don’t mind my asking). &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;If you are on a budget, it is probably best to skip Vail and Park City. The Utah resorts on the Salt Lake Valley side are great choices because you can usually find a good deal on a hotel that is only half an hour from the resorts, and the public transit will get you up to the lifts if you don’t want to drive."
