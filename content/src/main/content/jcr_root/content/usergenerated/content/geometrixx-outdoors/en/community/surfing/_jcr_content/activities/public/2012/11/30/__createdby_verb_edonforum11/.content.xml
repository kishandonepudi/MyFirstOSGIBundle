        jcr:description="Aaron thanks a ton for creating this community. I was thinking about doing the same, but then I thought that we wouldn’t get the numbers. I look forward to many great discussions with you and anyone else who is passionate about surfing. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;I would be jealous of your trip out to Oahu, but I’ve got my own vacation lined up. In fact, I’m packing right now to go hang out and watch the pros at the Triple Crown. I’ll get some time in on the waves, too, but I love to watch the best in the world tear it up. It’s amazing what they can do. It’s an art. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;So, I’ll be in Hawaii for three weeks. In addition to the popular spots like Sunset Beach and Waimea, I also plan on hitting up the Banzai Pipeline. I have been hesitant in years past because it is a rather dangerous spot, but I’m feeling pretty confident this year.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Ha ha. Kidding. I’m not going to get myself killed. I’ll take pics of the pipeline but that’s it. Please let me know how your trip goes and I will be sure to post some pictures when I get back! "
