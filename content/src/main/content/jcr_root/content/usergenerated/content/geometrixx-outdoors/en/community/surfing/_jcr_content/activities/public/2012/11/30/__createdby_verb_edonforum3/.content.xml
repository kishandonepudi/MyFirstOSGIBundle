        jcr:description="I am planning a vacation, and I have gotten as far as 1) I’m getting my passport stamped and 2) I’m going to sit my butt on a warm beach. After reading up on this community, I have a sudden itch to try out surfing. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Since I will be leaving the country, Hawaii is not on my list of destinations. Plus, I will be going next spring and from what I can tell the waves aren’t so fantastic then anyway. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where I should go? I’m pretty open to anything."
