        jcr:description="It doesn’t matter what you’re up to. If its winter, and if you’re outside enjoying, you are going to need a pair of quality gloves. If your hands are freezing, it doesn’t matter how bundled up the rest of you is…you’re going to be miserable. I would recommend to the ladies that you check out the Classic leather gloves. They’re made of genuine leather so you know they’ll last, and so far they have done a fine job of keeping me warm."
