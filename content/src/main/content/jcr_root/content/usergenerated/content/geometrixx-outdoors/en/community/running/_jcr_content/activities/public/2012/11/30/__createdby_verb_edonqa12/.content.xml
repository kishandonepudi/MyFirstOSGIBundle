        jcr:description="Jason, I have become a bit of an expert on this topic because of my own knee problems. If you over pronate, then you excessively rotate your foot inward. This can cause all sorts of problems from the arch of your foot to your knee. If you under pronate, you donâ€™t roll your foot enough, which can cause problems as well. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Honestly, your best option is to go to a doctor, physical therapist, or professional running coach and have your gait analyzed. They will tell you exactly what you are dealing with and what you can do to fix it."
