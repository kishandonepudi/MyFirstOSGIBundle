    jcr:description="In preparation for my upcoming trip to Hawaii, I have purchased the El Greco and taken it out a few times with my 5mm wetsuit. I have got to say, for the price itâ€™s a pretty incredible board. I plan to provide a more detailed product review later, but for now I will say that the board is very well balanced and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get into the sport!"
