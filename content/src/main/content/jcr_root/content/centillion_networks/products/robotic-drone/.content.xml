                text="&lt;p>&lt;u>&lt;b>About Drones :&lt;/b>&lt;/u>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS); which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator, or fully or intermittently autonomously, by onboard computers.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>About Robotic Arm :&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot. The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an articulated robot) or translational (linear) displacement. The links of the manipulator can be considered to form a kinematic chain. The terminus of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the end effector and it is analogous to the human hand.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;u>About Our Robotic Drone :&lt;/u>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Centillion robotic drone is a state of art of technology equipped with sensors, detection instruments, image scanning and data communication apparatus like LiDAR camera, torsion sensors, servo motors and drives, Wi-Fi transmitter, Gyroscope, accelerometer, actuators, joystick, flight controller. Unlike conventional approaches as foot patrols, aerial surveys, the robotic drone is more efficient and safer to assure higher maintenance quality. Thus it is has a broad engineering application prospects.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Centillion ROBOTIC DRONE equipped with a ROBOTIC ARM autonomously performs the maintenance of EHV (Extra High Voltage) transmission lines at a reduced operational costs and enhanced safety. In conventional method, visual patrols from a helicopter, performs the maintenance task. As helicopter is prone to come in contact with the EHV transmission lines, human lives are at risk. To deal with this concern, Centillion has developed a robotic drone with technological marvel, which performs efficiently the maintenance of broken or damaged splice and avoids hazards to humans such as the risk of falling and electric shock.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;"
