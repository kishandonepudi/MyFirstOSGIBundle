We ask that if you decide to join this hike, you have hiked at least 3 days carrying all your gear and food. This is a difficult hike, so if you are considering joining, please grab a topo map and give the trail a good review before you make your final decision. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;I would like to look into scheduling at least three meet-ups before hand so we can discuss gear, safety, etc. Let me know if you’re interested."

From there you can explore, enjoy the park, and do pretty much whatever you want. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Since it’s in a national park, there are strict hike times—we need to be there ready to go at 8:00am. Also, there is a 25-person limit to each group, so it is a first-come-first-serve event. Let me know if you’re interested."

As we look forward to the holiday season, I think it would be a great idea to all pitch in and help out those in need. Even if we aren’t rich and glamorous, a few cans of food here and there, or maybe an old jacket or blanket that you won’t use anymore can go a long way toward helping brighten someone else’s day. &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;My family and I will be posted up at the library pretty much all day long, so please fell free to stop by whenever you get a moment."
